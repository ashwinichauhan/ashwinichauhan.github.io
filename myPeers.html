    <h3> My Peer's Perspective on Umass Boston</h3>
    <p>Satomi:The ISC buildings conference rooms. It allows us to work together in groups in a private setting with whiteboards and a tv screen.</p>
    <p>  Aisha:How the campus is always developing and always improving as a university. The various organizations on campus that let students get involved with off campus outreaches. We have academic support for those who may not be doing so well in calc *cough* *cough* *me*</p>
     <p> Bryon:Honors college because the teachers are helpful and supportive. Also noodles are great</p>
     <p> Saj:The ping pong table allows us to destress after a long day of hard work</p>
     <p> Ira:Opportunities that are available here for students. Location of UMB</p>
     <p> Justin:A diverse community</p>
     <p> Alex:people are social and friends and the view at the ISC</p>
     <p> Aisha pt.2: I love how news travels so fast and it's so social on twitter and active that if there is any delays or emergencies people know about it immediately. SAEC also have many awesome things going on like free fun for everyone which is great. Were so happening. It's never boring.</p>
